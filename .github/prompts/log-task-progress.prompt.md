# Log Task Progress

Generate a progress log entry for the `cline_docs/progress-log.md` file following the Capital IQ Strategic Intelligence Engine documentation standards.

Based on the documentation requirements, create structured progress entries that track daily accomplishments, blockers, decisions, and lessons learned.

## Progress Log Information

Ask for the following details if not provided:

### Task Information
- **Task name** and identifier
- **Owner/assignee** 
- **Current status** (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
- **Completion percentage** (0-100%)

### Progress Details
- **Objective**: What was the goal of this task?
- **Approach**: How did you tackle the problem?
- **Implementation**: What was actually built/completed?
- **Next steps**: What needs to happen next?

### Context Information
- **Date** of the progress update
- **Time spent** on the task
- **Dependencies** completed or still pending
- **Blockers encountered** and their resolution status

## Progress Log Format

Generate entries using this standardized format:

```markdown
## Day [X]: [Date]

### Accomplishments
- **[Task ID]**: [Task Name]
  - **Status**: [Completed/In Progress/Blocked] ([Percentage]%)
  - **Objective**: [What we aimed to achieve]
  - **Implementation**: [What was actually built/completed]
  - **Impact**: [How this contributes to demo/strategic goals]
  - **Time Spent**: [Hours/effort]

### Technical Decisions Made
- **[Decision Topic]**: [Description of decision and rationale]

## Daily Review Questions

Address these questions in each progress entry:

1. **Progress Against Plan**: Are we on track for our 5-day timeline?
2. **Risk Mitigation**: What risks were addressed today?
3. **Demo Readiness**: How does today's work improve the demo?
4. **Technical Debt**: What shortcuts were taken that need future attention?
5. **Team Coordination**: How well did different layers integrate?

## Output Template
